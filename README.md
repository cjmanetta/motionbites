# Motion Moments
Motion Moments is a health and wellness application that combats excessive sitting with short, easy-to-follow video exercises displayed regularly throughout the workday. Users follow an engaging progression of simple, learnable routines tailored to their personal fitness metrics and doable in a typical office environment. This project is built in Ruby on Rails but will likely incorporate other technologies such as React, the Vimeo API and OAuth. Motion Moments is just getting off the ground and there are many exciting things to come!
